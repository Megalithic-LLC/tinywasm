# ðŸš§ Status

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in development and is not ready for use.

I'm currently working on supporting the WebAssembly MVP (1.0) specification. You can see the current status in the graph below. The goal is to support all the features of the MVP specification and then move on to the next version.

</p>

## Features

- **`std`**\
  Enables the use of `std` and `std::io` for parsing from files and streams. This is enabled by default.
- **`logging`**\
  Enables logging using the `log` crate. This is enabled by default.
- **`parser`**\
  Enables the `tinywasm-parser` crate. This is enabled by default.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Interpreted Runtime (no JIT)
- Self-hosted (can run itself compiled to WebAssembly)
- No unsafe code
- Works on `no_std` (with `alloc` the feature and nightly compiler)
- Fully support WebAssembly MVP (1.0)
- Low Memory Usage (less than 10kb)
- Fast Startup Time
- Preemptive multitasking support
