# ðŸŽ¯ Goals

* Interpreted Runtime (no JIT)
* Self-hosted (can run itself compiled to WebAssembly)
* No unsafe code
* Works on `no_std` (with `alloc` the feature and nightly compiler)
* Fully support WebAssembly MVP (1.0)
* Low Memory Usage (less than 10kb)
* Fast Startup Time
* Preemptive multitasking support
